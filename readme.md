# Computer NetworkðŸ“¡

### What is Network? 
`It is a group or system of interconnected people or item.`

### Then, What is Computer network? 
`When we have bunch of computers and they are interconnected (with cables or wireless) with each other that is called as Computer Network.`

### In Laymen's language
`Sharing of resources and communication is the main agenda that we are here with computer networks if computer networks don't exist all of this resource or communication sharing machanism will become paralise`

### What is internet?
`In a nutshell internet is a network of computer networks. Complex web of interconnected computer networks.`

## Histroy of Internet

1. In 1957, Soviet union launched the first satellite name Sputnik this was revolution in the field of communication. 
2. Then later, US government launched ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency) this was mainly sciencetific and technical advancement US did. 
3. Around 1960's - 1970's they build the communication system for ARPA's computers to talk means interact or share information and then in 1969 ARPANET was born.
4. Around 1980's, they started progressiong ARPANET to a new protocol instead of just Transmission control protocol, they started transmitting into TCP/IP protocol. At this point of time ARPANET was started calling as internet.
5. Around 1990's CERN researchers similarly felt the need of sharing of information and At that point of time they started using the similar technology and CERN use to use hyper link based document.
6. And then, There was guy time burner who introduced WWW. In WWW network they use to store ands retrive this hyper link based document.
7. That how the modern internet works everthing is html.
8. And then later, few intial browsers came into the picture and it mozaik and netscape

### Protocols
Network Protocols are the set of rules and regulations setup to communicate and share information over a network.
For eg: HTTP, UDP, SMTP and TCP etc.

### Packets
In order to share data, we can't send big chunck of data over the network. So we divide the data in smaller chunks, these small chunks are called as packets.

### Address
Sending messages over the network requires the destination details. This detail uniquely identify the end system is called as address.

### Ports
- `Any machine could be running many network apps. In order to distinguish these apps for receiving messages we use ports (Port number).`

- `IP-address + Port = Socket`

- `Port helps you get the packets to specific process on the host.` 

- `Every process has 16 bit port number.`
range of port number -> {0 - 2^16 = 65535}

- `0 - 1023: Well known ports`
For eg: port 80 belongs to http and port 443 belongs to https 

- `1024 - 49152: Registered Ports`
They are used by specific, potentially proprietory apps/process that are known but not system defined.
For eg: port 1433 belongs to Sql server and for mongo it is 27017.

- `49152 - 65535: Dynamic ports`

### Access Networks
These are media using which end systems connect to the internet.

- `Network Interface adapter: It enables a computer to attach to a network. As there are different types of networks, It acts as a single suit  to connect to any network.`

### DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
DSL uses the existing telephone ground work lines for internet connection. Generally DSL is provided by same company which supplies telephone service.

### ISP (Internet Service Provider)
It is just a company that provides end users internet connection.
For eg: AT&T
